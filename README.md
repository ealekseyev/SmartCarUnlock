# SmartCarUnlock
Retrofit of Keyless Entry to a 2001 Mercedes C-class

Features two ways to unlock the car:
 - Knock-to-unlock
A preset knock sequence can be used to unlock the car
 - 32-bit key RFID Scanner 
An RFID chip - which could even be implanted into the hand - can be used to unlock the car. It uses a uniquely generated 32-bit key to authenticate to an Arduino and unlock; more than 4 billion possible combinations means it is more than secure enough.
